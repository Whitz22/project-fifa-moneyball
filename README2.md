## The challenge

We have been hired to analyse the performance of Manchester's city team. Our aim was to perform an end-to-end analysis putting into practice what we have learned so far. We will apply statistical or machine learning techniques and present our results to the class.

### Our outcome

To improve the team's performance, here are the different steps that we followed: 
- Step 1: **Data Cleaning** to decide which columns we would take into account in our analysis. 
- Step 2: **Identifying and replacing low-performing players** We first analysed the overall score and potential of each players. As MC is an excellent team, we decided to compare it to the TOP 10 teams in the Champions league. We then took into account the release date and age of players to match our budget constraint. 
- Step 3: **Hiring substitutes within a budget** We started by analysing the market trends and importand insights (Ex: countries with promising players, the correlation betweeen age and gap to potential). We then focused on the positions of the player identified in our previous step. 
- Step 4: **Providing market insights for the future**

## Objectives

- Ask interesting and thoughtful questions and find the data to answer them.
- Focus on improving in areas that are hard for you or learning more about something with which you feel comfortable.
- Apply the statistical and machine learning techniques we have learned.
- Create useful and clear graphs.
- Present your insights in a thoughtful, clear, and accurate way.

## Dataset

In this project, you will use the provided [fifa23_players_dataset](https://github.com/ta-data-pt-rmt/project-fifa-moneyball/blob/main/fifa_23_male.zip) dataset.

Details about the dataset can be found here as well [kaggle description](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjeetsinghnaik/fifa-23-players-dataset/)

## Instructions & Scope

- You **must plan your project.** Creating a Kanban or using [Trello](https://trello.com/) or a similar app for a digital board is mandatory.
- You **CAN'T CODE** until your project is planned.
- Create a `*.gitignore*` file and include it in your repository.
- As an optional you can include a linear regression as a way to answer question(s) on the data.

## Deliverables

- A well-commented Jupyter notebook with your analysis.
- The final dataset after all cleaning and transformations.
- Repository with your workflow + documentation + code.
- Visual documentation of Kanban or Trello board link.

## Tips & Tricks

- Organize yourself (don't get lost!). Respect deadlines.
- Ask for help but don't forget that Google is your friend.
- Define a simple approach first. You never know how the data can betray you. :wink:
- Document your work.
- Learn about the problem and what research has been done before you.
- Before making a graph, think about what you want to represent.
